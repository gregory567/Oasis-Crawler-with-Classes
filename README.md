# Oasis-Crawler-with-Classes
This project comprises a two-dimensional game world explored by a user-controlled character. The character wins the game by finding all the relics scattered throughout the world and loses if they die due to the dangers of the world. The game is implemented with the use of classes and other constructs of OOP.
